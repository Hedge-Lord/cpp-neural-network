# C++ Neural Network Library

## Introduction
This C++ Neural Network Library is a custom implementation of a neural network with backpropagation. It is designed to allow adjustable network topology and learning rate, making it suitable for a variety of applications. The library integrates OpenMP for enhanced multithreading capabilities, significantly improving training speed. Additionally, it features an intuitive UI, built with SFML, for real-time training and predictions.

## Features
- Custom neural network implementation in C++.
- Backpropagation algorithm for efficient learning.
- Adjustable network topology and learning rate.
- Multithreading support using OpenMP libraries.
- Real-time training and prediction visualization using SFML.
- Ability to predict pixel color based on given inputs.

## Requirements
- C++ Compiler (C++17 or later recommended).
- SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for UI and visualization.
- OpenMP for multithreading support.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hedge-Lord/cpp-neural-network.git
```
2. Navigate to the downloaded directory.

### Setting Up SFML
3. Download and install SFML 2.6.1 from [SFML Download](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php).
4. Set up the additional include libraries path and additional library dependencies path in your IDE to use SFML libraries.

## Usage
### Running the Application
- Download the `Debug` folder containing the `.exe` and all necessary `.dlls`.
- Run `Neural Network.exe` to start the application.

### Adjusting Network Parameters
- Open the solution in your IDE.
- Modify network parameters as desired in the provided configuration files or directly in the code.
